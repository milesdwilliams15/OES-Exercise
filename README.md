# OES Exercise
This repository contains work relevant to Miles Williams' response to the OES data analysis exercise required for application for the OES Methods Team part-time Associate Fellow position. Code used to merge datasets and to conduct the main analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/analysis%20code.R). Code used to create `BMlmSE`, a function for estimating Bell-McCaffrey standard errors, can be found [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/BM%20std%20errors.R). Code used to test covariate balance between treatment arms of the study is located [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/testing%20balance.R). Code for testing for asymmetry in attrition between arms is located [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/testing%20attrition.R). Code used for covariate selection in model estimation is located [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/variable%20selection.R). The writeup for my answer to the data exercise is provided in both [R Markdown](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/response.Rmd) and [pdf](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/OES-Exercise/blob/master/response.pdf) formats.
